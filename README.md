## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Windows Users (Recommended)

1. **Download or clone** this repository
2. **Double-click** `run.bat` in the project folder
3. **Wait** for automatic setup (Python check, virtual environment, dependencies)
4. **Start analyzing** your files!

The `run.bat` script will automatically:
- Check for Python 3.10+ installation
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies
- Launch the FileAnalyzer application

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fileanalyzer/FileAnalyzer.git
cd FileAnalyzer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python -m src.main
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Download from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/)
- **Windows 10/11** (primary support), macOS 10.14+, or Linux
- **~50MB** disk space for installation
- **Administrator rights** (for certain file operations)

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. **File Scanning**
- Launch the application and navigate to the **Files** tab
- Click **"Browse"** to select a directory to analyze
- Wait for the scan to complete (progress bar will show status)

### 2. **Duplicate Detection**
- Go to **Management** tab ‚Üí **Duplicate Finder**
- Click **"Start Analysis"** to find duplicate files
- Review detected duplicates with confidence levels
- Select files to remove and confirm deletion

### 3. **Large File Analysis**
- Go to **Management** tab ‚Üí **Large File Analyzer** 
- Configure size threshold (default: 100MB)
- Start analysis to identify largest files
- Review cleanup recommendations and take action

### 4. **Age-Based Archival**
- Go to **Management** tab ‚Üí **File Age Analyzer**
- Analyze files by modification date
- View age distribution and archival candidates
- Export lists for batch archival operations

### 5. **Export & Reports**
- Export analysis results in CSV or JSON format
- Generate cleanup reports for documentation
- Save recommendations for future reference

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Thresholds
- **Large File Threshold**: Adjust from 1MB to 10GB
- **Age Categories**: Customize time periods for archival
- **Duplicate Confidence**: Configure heuristic vs content-based detection

### File Operations
- **Safe Mode**: Confirmation dialogs for all destructive operations
- **Batch Operations**: Select multiple files for bulk actions
- **Undo Support**: Recycle bin integration where available

## üìä Analysis Capabilities

### File Statistics
- Total files and directories scanned
- Size distribution across categories
- Age distribution analysis
- File type breakdown

### Cleanup Recommendations
- **High Priority**: Large old files (>100MB, >1 year)
- **Medium Priority**: Duplicate files and stale data
- **Low Priority**: Small old files and temporary files

### Export Formats
- **CSV**: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic processing
- **Reports**: Human-readable cleanup summaries

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and in PATH
- Run `run.bat` as Administrator if needed
- Check antivirus software isn't blocking execution

**Slow scanning:**
- Large directories (>100k files) may take time
- Network drives are slower than local storage
- Consider excluding system directories

**Permission errors:**
- Run as Administrator for system file access
- Some protected files cannot be analyzed
- Enable long path support on Windows (see WINDOWS_SETUP.md)

**Memory usage:**
- Large file sets may use significant RAM
- Consider analyzing subdirectories separately
- Close other applications during analysis
