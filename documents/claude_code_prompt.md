## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
The application already has:
- Sophisticated theme system (theme_manager.py)
- Advanced visualization components (visualization/ module)
- File management tools (management/ module)
- Worker thread system (analysis_workers.py)
- Modern UI components with custom widgets

### Key Files to Understand
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `theme_manager.py` - Theme system implementation
- `management/` - File management dashboard components
- `visualization/` - Chart and visualization widgets
- `analysis_workers.py` - Background processing workers

### Development Approach
1. Study the existing codebase thoroughly before making changes
2. Test each integration step incrementally
3. Maintain the high quality standards already established
4. Use the existing patterns rather than introducing new paradigms

## Final Deliverables

1. **Integrated Main Window** - All components working together seamlessly
2. **Custom Directory Selection** - Full directory browsing capability
3. **Persistent Settings** - User preferences saved and restored
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Smooth handling of large directories
5. **Comprehensive Tests** - Validation of all new functionality
6. **Documentation** - Updated documentation for new features

Remember: This is a mature, sophisticated application. Your role is to integrate and polish existing high-quality components, not to rebuild fundamental functionality. Focus on creating a seamless, professional user experience that leverages the excellent foundation already in place.
