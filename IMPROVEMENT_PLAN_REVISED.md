**Objective**: Enable users to analyze any directory, not just the home directory

**What Was Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced DirectoryTreeView** (`src/ui/directory_tree.py`):
   - Added `set_root_directory(path)` method with validation and permission checking
   - Modified `populate_tree(root_path=None)` to support custom root paths
   - Added `get_root_path()` method for current root directory access
   - Implemented graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Enhanced Main Window** (`src/ui/main_window.py`):
   - Added "Browse" button to left panel with modern styling
   - Implemented directory selection dialog using `QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory()`
   - Added smart directory starting (opens from current/selected directory)
   - Integrated auto-scanning of newly selected directories
   - Added user-friendly error messages for invalid directories

3. **Comprehensive Testing** (`tests/test_gui.py`):
   - Added `test_directory_tree_custom_root()` test method
   - Tests validation of invalid paths, permissions, and edge cases
   - All 8 tests pass, including new functionality

**Results**:
- ✅ **Critical Issue Resolved**: Users can now select ANY directory for analysis

## Conclusion

This application has evolved far beyond a simple file analyzer into a **professional-grade file management and analysis suite**. The focus should now be on **integration, polish, and advanced enterprise features** rather than basic functionality implementation.

The original improvement plan significantly underestimated the current sophistication of the codebase. With comprehensive theming, advanced visualization, smart file management tools, and extensive test coverage already in place, this project represents a mature, enterprise-ready application that needs refinement and integration rather than fundamental feature development.
